Drawing upon the mystical power within, they can communicate without speaking, move objects, alter their physical bodies, and even manifest spells. Relying solely on mastery of their mind, Psions can perform feats thought impossible, even by the most erudite Wizards and devout Clerics. For Psions, it is a point of great pride that they can produce wonders without the help of external power. Due to their potential, Psions are often misunderstood and feared by the common folk. If they don’t learn to control their power, their strange abilities can cause them to be shunned and hated by those around them. Most Psions reveal their power only when necessary, and are hesitant to trust others.</content>
